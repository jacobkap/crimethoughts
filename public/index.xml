      <description>Why say no This chapter is primarily focused towards academics conducting research. While it may apply to other fields, it discusses choosing which studies to conduct, which may be a privilege not afforded to other jobs. For this reason, please feel free to skip this chapter if you&amp;rsquo;d like.^[Academics who have more hourly tweets than lifetime publications should stop reading this chapter and start writing more papers.]
Academia is built on uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Last year marked the first year that the FBI stopped collecting UCR data and only took NIBRS data from police agencies.

In 2019 there were 92,865 robberies reported among agencies that reported data in both 2019 and 2020. Of those, 7,349 had a motor vehicle stolen which means they were carjackings. Thatâ€™s about 7.9% of robberies being carjackings. In 2020 the number of robberies remained nearly the same at 92,230 while those with a vehicle stolen from the robbery (i.</description>
