      <description>Why say no This chapter is primarily focused towards academics conducting research. While it may apply to other fields, it discusses choosing which studies to conduct, which may be a privilege not afforded to other jobs. For this reason, please feel free to skip this chapter if you&amp;rsquo;d like.^[Academics who have more hourly tweets than lifetime publications should stop reading this chapter and start writing more papers.]
Academia is built on uncertainty.</description>

      <description>Last year marked the first year that the FBI stopped collecting UCR data and only took NIBRS data from police agencies. Now, 16 months after they started collecting data we still have another 6 or 7 months to wait until they release the data, as the FBI normally releases NIBRS in October or November of the year following the data collection. NIBRS data has been around since 1991 so criminologists have had over 30 years to prepare for using NIBRS data instead of relying on UCR data.</description>
