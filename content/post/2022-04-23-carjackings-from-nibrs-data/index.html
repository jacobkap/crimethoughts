<p>Carjackings make up a fairly high share of all robberies, at least higher than I expected. In 2019 there were 92,865 robberies reported among agencies that reported data in both 2019 and 2020. Of those, 7,349 had a motor vehicle stolen which means they were carjackings. That’s about 7.9% of robberies being carjackings. In 2020 the number of robberies remained nearly the same at 92,230 while those with a vehicle stolen from the robbery (i.e. a carjacking) increased by 9,575, about a 30% increase from 2019. As a share of all robberies, in 2020 carjackings made up 10.4% of robberies. So there’s a pretty large increase in percent terms.</p>
<p>But this is still misleading. When you car is stolen you almost always need a police report for insurance purposes. That’s why motor vehicle theft is one of the best reported crimes. According to the National Crime Victimization Report (NCVS), 79.5% of motor vehicle theft victims reported the theft to the police in 2019 (95% CI [72.43-85.07]). In 2020 that number decreased to 74.6% (95% CI [67.35, 80.76]). (For all the NCVS numbers I am using the extremely useful Bureau of Justice Statistics data tool <a href="https://ncvs.bjs.ojp.gov/single-year-comparison/crimeType">here</a>) NCVS doesn’t ask about carjacking directly (at least not on this data tool) so we don’t know exactly what the reporting rate is for it. You still need a police report for insurance if it’s stolen in a robbery or just a normal theft, so there’s still the strong motivation for reporting to the police. I’d guess (without any evidence) that people are more likely to report when they are carjacked than when their car is just stolen.</p>
<p>Robberies on the other hand, are much less reported. According to the same NCVS data, about 46.6% of robberies in 2019 (95% CI [36.69-56.85]) and 54.3% in 2020 (95% CI [43.36-64.91]) were reported to the police. Again, since this is NCVS the robberies include carjacking alongside other robberies. So this means that our numerator (carjackings) is better reported than our denominator (all robberies). Basically, this inflates the share of robberies than are carjackings.</p>
<p>Since we have the reporting rate we can adjust our NIBRS numbers to account for that. Let’s just assume that carjackings are perfectly reported so our NIBRS numbers are the true numbers. Now let’s adjust our robbery numbers by NCVS reporting rates. To do this we multiple our NIBRS numbers for each year by 1/reporting_rate that year. In 2019 there were 92,865 robberies and a reporting rate of 46.6% so 92,865*(1/0.466) = 199,281 robberies. For 2020 that’s 92,230*(1/0.543) = 169,852 robberies.</p>
<p>Then our 2019 share of carjackings is 7,349/199,281 = 0.037
And the 2020 share is 9,575/169,852 = 0.056</p>
<p>The percent change is actually bigger here, with a 51.4% increase from 2019 to 2020. Now we used NCVS data which is nationally representative. Our NIBRS data is not nationally representative, far from it. NCVS doesn’t allow us to be more detailed than national data or large subregions so this is as good as we’ll get using this data. And no other data that I’m aware of can function as a replacement of NCVS. So is this a worthless exercise since we’re trying to use national data to adjust for missingness in non-representative non-national data?</p>
