      <description>Last year marked the first year that the FBI stopped collecting Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) data and only took National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) data from police agencies. Now, 16 months after they started collecting data we still have another 6 or 7 months to wait until they release the data, as the FBI normally releases NIBRS in October or November of the year following the data collection. NIBRS data has been around since 1991 so criminologists have had over 30 years to prepare for using NIBRS data instead of relying on UCR data.</description>
