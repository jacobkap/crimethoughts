    <div class="article-content">
      <p>Last year marked the first year that the FBI stopped collecting UCR data and only took NIBRS data from police agencies. Now, 16 months after they started collecting data we still have another 6 or 7 months to wait until they release the data, as the FBI normally releases NIBRS in October or November of the year following the data collection. NIBRS data has been around since 1991 so criminologists have had over 30 years to prepare for using NIBRS data instead of relying on UCR data. I don&rsquo;t think they used this time well, and we&rsquo;ll soon be entering a painful era for criminology in handling this transition. One that I do not believe many are ready for, or even anticipate.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s start with what the change will actually entail.</p>
<p>UCR is essentially driving along a one lane dirt road in the middle of nowhere. There&rsquo;s not many places you can go but you probably won&rsquo;t get lost. You could probably make the drive on a donkey.^[It is difficult to know who does more braying, the academic who uses every tragedy to push their research and preferred policies, or the donkey.] NIBRS is driving along a major interstate near a population center. It&rsquo;s a much more complicated drive with more chances of accidents but also many more places to go. Your donkey isn&rsquo;t going to cut it.</p>
